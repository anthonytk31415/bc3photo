log out button

images upload mechanism (DONE)


pathway for when a user is not logged in and a prompt to log in
- what's that design? 

in the about page: 
- decrease the Billy image dynamically based on the screen size; 

react routes: 
- switch from BrowserRouter over to createBrowserRouter
- fix weird message "can't find routes"


login: 
- when logging in; close the window 

createblogpost
- need to add in "delete" element functionality 
- add in path for successful submission

clean up console logs for tidiness - why does the console think i have no path? 


Frontend NOTES: 
fetch requests happen: 
- blog (get)
- createblogpost (post)
- blogEntry (get)
