log out button

images upload mechanism 


pathway for when a user is not logged in and a prompt to log in
- what's that design? 

in the about page: 
- decrease the Billy image dynamically based on the screen size; 

react routes: 
- switch from BrowserRouter over to createBrowserRouter
- fix weird message "can't find routes"
